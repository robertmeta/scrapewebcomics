# Scrape Webcomics

This project has the simple and laughable purpose to help you bulk download webcomics.

I love webcomics and when I find a new one, I generally want to get all of it and not via the web UI because, sadly, most web comics UIs are awful and slow.

It is all vanilla go with no external dependencies, and the code is crap, but functional for the moment. I will be adding in more sites over time.

# Contributing

If you want to contribute a site, the rules are simple: 

- siteurl-page%04d-image%04d
- vanilla go
- must work with **go run**
